I'll analyze the current state of the Oxide Flow project and help you understand where we are and what's next. Let me first examine the current codebase to get a clear picture. Based on my analysis of the current codebase and your requirements, here's a comprehensive assessment of where Oxide Flow stands and what needs to be done next:

## Current Project Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Core Architecture**: You have a solid foundation with:
   - Well-defined `Oxi` trait with async processing
   - `OxiData` enum for different data types (JSON, Text, Binary, Empty)
   - `OxiConfig` for configuration management
   - Basic CLI structure with clap
   - Started implementing JSON and CSV Oxis

2. **Project Structure**: Clean modular architecture following the planned design

### ❌ What's Missing/Incomplete
1. **No `oxiflow init` command** - Critical for user onboarding
2. **No YAML pipeline execution** - Core functionality missing
3. **No environment variable substitution** (`${ENV_VAR}`)
4. **No pipeline step referencing** (`${reader.metadata.path}`)
5. **No Oxi registry system** for validation
6. **Incomplete CLI** - missing pipeline execution commands

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Implement `oxiflow init` Command (Highest Priority)
This is essential for user experience and sets up the project structure you outlined:

**Implementation Plan:**
```rust
// Add to cli.rs
#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
pub enum Commands {
    Init {
        /// Project name (optional, will prompt if not provided)
        #[arg(short, long)]
        name: Option<String>,
    },
    Run {
        /// Path to pipeline YAML file
        #[arg(short, long, default_value = "pipelines/pipeline.yaml")]
        pipeline: String,
    },
}
```

**File Structure to Create:**
```
project_name/
├── oxiflow.yaml          # Main project config with Oxi registry
├── output/               # Output directory
├── oxis/                 # Downloaded Oxis directory
└── pipelines/
    └── pipeline.yaml     # Default JSON->CSV pipeline
```

### 2. Complete YAML Configuration System
**Missing Features:**
- Environment variable substitution (`${ENV_VAR}`)
- Pipeline step referencing (`${reader.metadata.path}`)
- Validation against Oxi schemas
- Nested configuration support

### 3. Implement Pipeline Execution Engine
Create a pipeline executor that:
- Parses YAML pipeline definitions
- Validates against available Oxis
- Executes steps in sequence
- Handles data flow between steps

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Add init command** with project scaffolding
2. **Create default pipeline YAML** with JSON→CSV transformation
3. **Implement basic pipeline parser** for YAML files

### Phase 2: Configuration Enhancement (Week 2)
1. **Environment variable substitution** in YAML configs
2. **Step referencing system** for pipeline values
3. **Configuration validation** against Oxi schemas

### Phase 3: Execution Engine (Week 3)
1. **Pipeline execution engine** with proper error handling
2. **CLI commands** for running pipelines
3. **Oxi registry system** for validation

## Specific Questions for Implementation

1. **For the default pipeline.yaml**, should it be:
   ```yaml
   pipeline:
     - name: read_file
       id: reader
       config:
         path: "input.json"
     - name: parse_json
       id: parser
     - name: format_csv
       id: formatter
     - name: write_file
       id: writer
       config:
         path: "output/data.csv"
   ```

2. **For oxiflow.yaml structure**, should it look like:
   ```yaml
   project:
     name: "my_project"
     version: "1.0.0"
   
   oxis:
     core:
       version: "1.0.0"
       source: "builtin"
     custom_transforms:
       version: "0.1.0"
       source: "git://github.com/user/custom-oxis"
   
   settings:
     output_dir: "./output"
     pipeline_dir: "./pipelines"
   ```

Would you like me to start implementing the `oxiflow init` command first? This would give us the foundation to build the rest of the YAML configuration system on top of.
