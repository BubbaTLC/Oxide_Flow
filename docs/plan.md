# Oxide Flow Project Analysis

Based on your workspace structure, it looks like you have the foundation of the Oxide Flow project established with core files for the plugin system (Oxis), CLI interface, configuration, and error handling.

## Current Status Assessment

It appears you've implemented:
- Basic project structure with modular architecture
- Initial Oxis framework in oxis
- Basic Oxis for stdin/stdout operations
- CLI and configuration foundations
- Starting test structure

## Questions to Define Next Steps

1. What functionality is currently working in the project? Can you run any data transformations yet?
    1. No there is almost zer functonality at the moment, just the basic structure.
2. Are there specific data transformation use cases you're targeting first?
    1. Yes I want to start with basic file I/O operations, like reading and writing files, and simple transformations like filtering and mapping data.
    1. I think it would be good to start with JSON and CSV formats. We can start by reading json and writing to csv. and vice versa.
    1. Lets create a csv oxi and a json oxi.
3. How far along is the YAML configuration implementation?
    1. The YAML configuration loading is not yet implemented.
    1. I want to make sure we have a strong standard structure/schema for the YAML config that can be easily extended later.
4. Have you started implementing the REST API layer?
    1. No, the REST API layer has not been started yet.
    1. Lets focus on cli and configuration first, then we can add the REST API later.
5. What's your priority between adding more Oxis vs. strengthening the core infrastructure?
    1. I think we should focus on strengthening the core infrastructure first, especially the Oxi trait/interface and configuration loading.
    1. Once we have a solid foundation, we can start adding more Oxis for specific data transformations.

## Proposed High-Level Project Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Architecture Completion**
   - Finalize the Oxi trait/interface design
   - Complete basic CLI argument parsing
   - Implement YAML configuration loading
   - Add comprehensive error handling

2. **Phase 2: Essential Oxis**
   - Develop file I/O Oxis (read/write files)
   - Add basic transformation Oxis (filter, map, etc.)
   - Implement data format Oxis (JSON, CSV parsing/formatting)
   - Create documentation for each Oxi

3. **Phase 3: API & Integration**
   - Design and implement REST API
   - Add authentication/security
   - Create integration examples with common tools
   - Build pipeline orchestration

4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - Implement advanced transformations
   - Add caching mechanisms
   - Create performance optimizations
   - Develop visualization capabilities

Let me know your current progress and priorities, and we can refine this plan!

Based on your responses, let's create a focused project plan that strengthens the core infrastructure before expanding to specific Oxis. Let me first examine your current implementation to understand what we're working with. Now that I have a better understanding of the current state, let me check the existing Oxis: Based on the current code review and your priorities, here's a detailed project plan focused on strengthening the core infrastructure before expanding to specific Oxis:

# Oxide Flow Project Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Enhance Oxi Trait Design
- Expand the `Oxi` trait to support more data types beyond just strings
- Add configuration capabilities to each Oxi
- Implement proper error handling and propagation
- Oxis should all be in their own modules under `src/oxis/` (e.g. `src/oxis/csv/oxi.rs`, `src/oxis/json/oxi.rs`)
- Ensure Oxis can be chained together with clear input/output contracts
- Document the Oxi trait and its usage in `docs/oxi.md`
- Create a oxi sdk template for new Oxis and document in `docs/oxi_sdk.md`

### 2. Implement YAML Configuration System
- Design a robust YAML schema for Oxi configurations
- Create configuration validation mechanisms
- Implement environment variable substitution
- Add support for nested configurations

### 3. Improve CLI Handling
- Enhance CLI to support chaining of Oxis
- Implement flags and options for each Oxi
- Add verbose/debug output modes
- Create help documentation for each Oxi

### 4. Add Core Error Handling
- Expand error types for different failure scenarios
- Implement user-friendly error messages
- Add debugging capabilities with verbose error outputs

## Phase 2: Essential Oxis (2-3 weeks)

### 1. File I/O Oxis
- Implement `ReadFile` and `WriteFile` Oxis
- Add directory operations
- Support for glob pattern matching

### 2. Data Format Oxis
- Create JSON parser/formatter Oxis
- Implement CSV reader/writer Oxis
- Add format conversion capabilities

### 3. Transformation Oxis
- Implement `Filter` for data filtering
- Create `Map` for data transformation
- Add `Sort` and `Group` operations

### 4. Documentation
- Document each Oxi's purpose and usage
- Create examples for common workflows
- Add configuration examples

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)

### 1. Pipeline Management
- Add pipeline state persistence
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Create logging and monitoring

### 2. REST API
- Design API endpoints
- Implement REST server
- Add authentication and security
- Create API documentation

### 3. Advanced Transformations
- Add complex data transformation capabilities
- Implement statistical operations
- Create visualization outputs

## Immediate Next Steps

Based on your current code and priorities, here's what I recommend focusing on next:

1. **Enhance the Oxi trait to support structured data**: Currently, the Oxi trait only works with strings. We should modify it to handle structured data like JSON objects or records.

2. **Develop a proper YAML configuration schema**: Design a configuration structure that allows for:
   - Global settings
   - Oxi-specific configurations
   - Pipeline definitions

3. **Implement the file I/O Oxis**: Create `ReadFile` and `WriteFile` Oxis as they'll be fundamental for most operations.

4. **Develop the JSON and CSV Oxis**: These will be essential for data format handling.
